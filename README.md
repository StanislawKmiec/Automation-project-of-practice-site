# Simple tests autoamtion for saucelabs traning page

## Introduction
Purpose of this project was to automate some basic tests on https://www.saucedemo.com/ training page. I just wanted to practice a little bit on my own. 
I faced some interesting problems Selenium with Java was used here. 
I also tried to follow rules of Page object model. Tests cover basic functionalities like loggin in, checking products,
adding to cart, simple checkout etc. Depndencies in project were managed by Maven. In project I use TEStNg annotations. I used to commons-io
to create screenhots in checkout tests. I also added some extent reports to cart page tests. I was using IntelliJ as IDE.
